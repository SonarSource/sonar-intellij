To produce SVG images:
* download from marketing design system or SonarQube, or create new image
* try to adapt to [IntelliJ Platform guidelines](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/principles/icons/), especially:
  * try to stick to the official color palette
  * use standard sizes (16x16 with 1px margin in most cases)
* provide _dark and/or @2x versions if needed
* you can use Inkscape to edit
* don't forget to cleanup SVG source after editing with Inkscape:
